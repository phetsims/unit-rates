# Unit Rates - model description

This is a high-level description of the model used in Unit Rates. It's intended for audiences
that are not necessarily technical.

A *ratio* is a comparison of two numbers. The two numbers are called *terms*. Ratios can be represented in different 
ways; in this simulations, they are represented as *fractions*.  The 2 terms in the rate are herein referred to as 
*numerator* and *denominator*, based on their position in the fraction. 

A *rate* is a ratio where the measurements are in different units. A *unit rate* is a rate where the denominator is 1.

For displaying the terms of a rate, we (necessarily) limit the number of decimal places displayed. The number of 
decimal places used in the simulation is as follows:

| units    | decimal places | example     |
| -------- |:--------------:| ----------- |
| cost     | 2              | $5.25       |
| quantity | 2              | 1.25 Apples |
| weight   | 2              | 2.35 pounds |
| miles    | 1              | 3.5 miles   |
| hours    | 2              | 2.75 hours  |

A *double number line* is used to show that there are many (even infinitely many) pairs of numbers that have
the same rate.  The top number line corresponds to the rate's numerator; the bottom number line corresponds to
the rate's denominator.  A *marker* is added to the double number line to indicate a specific rate.
  
|           | numerator range | denominator range  |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Fruit     | variable, cost  | 0-16 items         |
| Vegetable | variable, cost  | 0-16 items         | 
| Candy     | variable, cost  | 0-1.6 lbs          |
| Racing    | 0-200 miles     | variable, hours    |
