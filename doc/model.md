# Unit Rates - model description

This is a high-level description of the model used in Unit Rates. It's intended for audiences
that are not necessarily technical.

A *ratio* is a comparison of two numbers. The two numbers are called *terms*. Ratios can be represented in different 
ways; in this simulations, they are represented as *fractions*.  The 2 terms in the rate are herein referred to as 
the *numerator* and the *denominator*, corresponding to their function in the fraction. 

A *rate* is a ratio where the measurements are in different units. A *unit rate* is a rate where the denominator is 1.

A *double number line* is used to show that there are many (even infinitely many) pairs of numbers that have
the same rate.  The top number line corresponds to the rate's numerator; the bottom number line corresponds to
the rate's denominator.  

A *marker* is added to the double number line to indicate a specific rate. For each double 
number line, the range of 1 term is fixed, while the range of the other term varies based on the unit rate.
 
Displayed values are (necessarily) limited to a specific number of decimal places. The same number of decimal places
is used for all occurrences of a term (double number line, marker editor, scale, rate control, race track, timer,... )
Values are rounded to the desired number of decimal places using nearest-neighbor rounding.  

This table described the rates that appear in this simulation:
