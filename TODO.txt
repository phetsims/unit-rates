TODO list for unit-rates

Medium:
When selected item changes: cancel marker editor animation (TWEEN), cancel bag/item animations (model.step), cancel drags.
If marker editor is on it's way home when Reset All is pressed, it doesn't move immediately to home.
Handle cancellation of drags?
Duplication between ShoppingSceneNode and ShoppingLabSceneNode

Performance:
Reset All is a bit laggy on iPad
Switching items is a bit laggy on iPad

Misc:
TODO items in code
multi-touch testing
check for memory leaks
