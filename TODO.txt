TODO list for unit-rates

DoubleNumberLineNode: observe DoubleNumberLine Properties and create markers

ShoppingQuestion: when correctEmitter fires, add marker to DoubleNumberLine.questionMarkers

DoubleNumberLineAccordionBox: clear DoubleNumberLine.undoMarkerProperty when undo button is moved to home position

Test DoubleNumberLine.scaleoMarkerProperty, even though we don't have a scale yet.

Put icons under markers on DNL, to tie them to scale or questions?
