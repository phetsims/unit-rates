TODO list for unit-rates

High:
Questions panel layout
Add 3rd decimal place to cost display on scale
Items on shelf and scale

Medium:
Reset button for shelf + scale (move things from scale to shelf, put all items back into bags)
When selected item changes, cancel marker editor animation.
When selected item changes, cancel bag/item animations.
If marker editor is on it's way home when Reset All is pressed, it doesn't move immediately to home.

Misc:
bags and items look crappy as images, try mipmaps?
TODO items in code
multi-touch testing
check for memory leaks

Terminology: team refers to fruit/vegetable/candy as "scene", implementation uses "category", change implementation?
