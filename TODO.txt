TODO list for unit-rates

Problem:
1. use marker editor for Apples
2. enter 6.2 denominator
3. enter $3.12 numerator
4. marker gets created at 3.10/6.2, because markers are created based on denominator, 3.12/0.50=6.2, and 6.2*0.50=3.10

DoubleNumberLineNode: observe DoubleNumberLine Properties and create markers

ShoppingQuestion: when correctEmitter fires, add marker to DoubleNumberLine.questionMarkers

DoubleNumberLineAccordionBox: clear DoubleNumberLine.undoMarkerProperty when undo button is moved to home position

Test DoubleNumberLine.scaleMarkerProperty, even though we don't have a scale yet.

Put icons under markers on DNL, to tie them to scale or questions?

Keypad lets you enter 0 for denominator, division-by-zero problem?
