TODO list for unit-rates

ShoppingQuestion: when correctEmitter fires, add Marker( { erasable:false, color:'green' } )

Don't create a marker if one already exists.

Replace existing marker with a question marker.

What to do when what's on the scale matches a question marker? Should question marker take precedence?

Keypad lets you enter 0 for denominator in "Items for $N" questions. How to prevent user from entering zero? Or just ignore zero?

Can you create a marker at 0/0 using the marker editor?
