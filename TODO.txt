TODO list for unit-rates

High:
Questions panel layout, https://github.com/phetsims/unit-rates/issues/152
Add 3rd decimal place to cost display on scale, https://github.com/phetsims/unit-rates/issues/44
Items on shelf and scale

Medium:
resetShelfButton, https://github.com/phetsims/unit-rates/issues/156
When selected item changes, cancel marker editor animation (TWEEN), cancel bag/item animations (model.step).
If marker editor is on it's way home when Reset All is pressed, it doesn't move immediately to home.

Misc:
bags and items look crappy as images, try mipmaps?
TODO items in code
