TODO list for unit-rates

High:
Instead 2 stacked rows, try a foreground and background row on a wider scale and shelf
Organization of items (2 rows) on shelf and scale should be transparent to ShoppingScene and ShoppingItemDragHandler
Should items (model and view) be created in ShoppingScene and ShoppingSceneNode constructors, or when a bag opens?
ShoppingScene constructor requires too much logic to create bags & items
ShoppingScene.reset requires too much logic to reset bags & items

Medium:
resetShelfButton, https://github.com/phetsims/unit-rates/issues/156
When selected item changes: cancel marker editor animation (TWEEN), cancel bag/item animations (model.step), cancel drags.
If marker editor is on it's way home when Reset All is pressed, it doesn't move immediately to home.
Handle cancellation of drags?
Duplication between ShoppingSceneNode and ShoppingLabSceneNode
Duplication between Shelf and Scale

Performance:
Reset All is a bit laggy on iPad
Switching items is a bit laggy on iPad

Misc:
TODO items in code
multi-touch testing
check for memory leaks

Terminology: team refers to fruit/vegetable/candy as "scene", implementation uses "category", change implementation?
